# Java CLI Input
Nice class(es) for basic java input handling :)

Has two classes of methods
- Regex: methods that utilise regular expressions to handle user input
- StandardInput: methods that only utilise `java.lang` classess to handle user input

Of these classes, the regex class is much more reliable and flexible.
